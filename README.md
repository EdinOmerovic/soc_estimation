# State of Charge Estimation Algorithm for Constrained Embedded devices

This repo contains the implementation of the state of charge estimation algorithm for duty-cycled embedded devices, particularly self-powered IoT devices. Together with the implementation, the repo contains the measurements and the documentation



- [ ] Add the high level algorithm features
- [ ] Explain the repo structure
- [ ] In the algorithm folder explain how the algorithm actually works
- [ ] Add future plans
