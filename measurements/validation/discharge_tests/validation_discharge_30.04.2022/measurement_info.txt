The measurements were done in two takes:

The first measurements started: 
30.04.2022 @ 09:33:19 and it lasted until 02.05.2022 @ 12:53:33

The second measrement was started due to interuption:
03.04.2022 @ 07:51:42 and it lasted until 04.05.2022 @ 18:18:54


These are the actual times. The times in measurement of output_validation_charge is ofsetted by 2 hours. 

In the output_validation_charge_edited I modified the outlier value of the voltage due to power supply turning on.
This is the one to use: unified_20220430_113319_adjusted_time
